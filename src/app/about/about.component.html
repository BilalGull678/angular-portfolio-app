                    My name is Barbara Calderon and I enjoy <span class="default-highlight">creating software out of an
                        idea</span>.

                <p class="default-p">
                    I am a Software Developer from Brazil. Portuguese is my native tongue and I am fluent in 
                    English. 
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">My interest in professional software started 
                    back in 2018 when I had to capture, clean and analyze thousands of data for my 
                    Master's Thesis on International Political Economy. Turns out, solving a problem
                    through coding taught me a great deal about <span class="default-highlight">programming,
                    logic</span> and <span class="default-highlight">automation</span>. Next year, I was back into college to study computers and
                    also landed my <span class="default-highlight">first job in the tech industry</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    Fast-forward to today, and so far I have had the privilege of working with fantastic
                    people in the industry.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    I have worked with <span class="default-highlight">several technologies</span> and developed valuable  
                    <span class="default-highlight">soft skills</span>, including leading transformative changes to enhance  
                    team dynamics and organizational culture in a tech company. My technical knowledge grew through hands-on  
                    collaboration with developers and diligent study of documentation. I gained experience in programming logic,  
                    refined software craftsmanship, contributed to developing <span class="default-highlight">websites</span>  
                    and <span class="default-highlight">REST APIs</span>, collaborated on building visual dashboards,  
                    <span class="default-highlight">scrapers</span>, <span class="default-highlight">crawlers</span>,  
                    and participated in retrieving and processing data from various sources.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    Working closely with teams, I helped implement <span class="default-highlight">microservices architectures</span>  
                    using <span class="default-highlight">Docker</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Kubernetes</span>,  
                    <span class="default-highlight">Rancher</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">ArgoCD</span>.  
                    I contributed to developing asynchronous systems with <span class="default-highlight">RabbitMQ</span>  
                    and optimizing CI/CD pipelines using <span class="default-highlight">Azure DevOps</span> and YAML configurations.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    I also contributed to creating and managing <span class="default-highlight">PostgreSQL</span> databases,  
                    stream processing, and data pipelines. My work included implementing secure authentication using  
                    <span class="default-highlight">OAuth2.0</span> and <span class="default-highlight">JWT</span>, conducting  
                    User Acceptance Testing (UATs), performing manual testing, and creating user manuals using <span class="default-highlight">LaTeX</span>.  
                    Additionally, I developed end-to-end tests with <span class="default-highlight">Cypress</span> and assisted  
                    in monitoring applications with <span class="default-highlight">Prometheus</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Grafana</span>,  
                    and centralized logging solutions.

                <p class="default-p">
                    I have to tell you — I know you probably hear this a lot from other developers, but it's true: my passion for technology  
                    goes far beyond work — <span class="default-highlight">I <em>am</em></span> the kind of person who finds joy in  
                    <span class="default-highlight">debugging tricky issues</span> and learning the intricacies of new frameworks just for fun.  
                    It's one of the reasons I pursued a Master's Degree — I was driven by sheer curiosity to turn the unknown into the known.  
                    I love diving into documentation, exploring innovative solutions, and <span class="default-highlight">sharing knowledge</span> with my peers.  
                    Whether I'm setting up a personal project to experiment with the latest tech stack or collaborating on a challenging problem,  
                    I'm motivated by curiosity and the thrill of continuous learning and continuous sharing. This mindset fuels my technical growth and, I believe,  
                    helps me contribute to a positive, dynamic team culture.

                    So far, we've covered the professional side. On a personal note, here are a few things about me: I have a passion for  
                    <span class="default-highlight">documentaries</span>, <span class="default-highlight">purpose-driven organizations</span>,  
                    black coffee, engaging book stories, <span class="default-highlight">teamwork</span>,  
                    <span class="default-highlight">science fiction</span> and <span class="default-highlight">suspense</span> movies (they're the best!),  
                    pesto sauce, Linux, and the joy of community experiences. When traveling, I enjoy documenting my 
                    <span class="default-highlight">whereabouts</span> and <span class="default-highlight">experiences</span>,  
                    so I can revisit them later.

                    I am continuously learning and adapting to new technologies and methodologies.
