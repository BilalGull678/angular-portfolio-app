                    I am a Software Developer from Brazil. Portuguese is my native language, and I am fluent in English. 
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">My interest in software development started back in 2018 when I had to capture, clean, and 
                    analyze thousands of data points for my Master's Thesis in International Political Economy. Solving problems 
                    through code introduced me to the world of <span class="default-highlight">programming</span>, 
                    <span class="default-highlight">logic</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">automation</span>. 
                    The following year, I returned to college to study computer science and landed my 
                    <span class="default-highlight">first job in the tech industry</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working with amazing people in the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    I've had the chance to work with a range of <span class="default-highlight">technologies</span> and developed valuable 
                    <span class="default-highlight">soft skills</span>, including leading transformative changes to improve 
                    team dynamics and organizational culture within a tech company. My technical knowledge has expanded 
                    through hands-on collaboration with developers and rigorous study of documentation. Over time, I've gained experience 
                    with programming logic, refined software craftsmanship, contributed to the development of 
                    <span class="default-highlight">websites</span> and built <span class="default-highlight">REST APIs</span>, 
                    collaborated on building visual dashboards, <span class="default-highlight">scrapers</span>, 
                    <span class="default-highlight">crawlers</span>, and participated in retrieving and processing data 
                    from various sources.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    I've worked with teams to adopt <span class="default-highlight">microservices architectures</span> using tools like
                    <span class="default-highlight">Docker</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Kubernetes</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Rancher</span>, 
                    and <span class="default-highlight">ArgoCD</span>. I've also been part of efforts to develop and maintain asynchronous systems 
                    with <span class="default-highlight">RabbitMQ</span> and optimizing CI/CD pipelines mainly using 
                    <span class="default-highlight">Azure DevOps</span> and YAML configurations.
                </p>
                <p class="default-p">
                    I do think <span class="default-highlight">DevOps</span> plays such an important role in enhancing 
                    <span class="default-highlight">collaboration</span> between <span class="default-highlight">development</span> 
                    and <span class="default-highlight">operations</span> teams because it <span class="default-highlight">streamlines</span> 
                    processes and improves the overall <span class="default-highlight">efficiency and quality of software delivery</span>. 
                    The optimization of workflows and reduction of system delays are significant factors for the success of project outcomes.

                    I have been involved in creating and managing <span class="default-highlight">PostgreSQL</span> 
                    databases, working on stream processing, and data pipelines. My work also involved handling secure authentication 
                    with <span class="default-highlight">OAuth2.0</span> and <span class="default-highlight">JWT</span>, 
                    as well as conducting User Acceptance Testing (UATs), performing manual testing, and writing user manual guides with  
                    <span class="default-highlight">LaTeX</span>. Furthermore, I developed end-to-end tests with 
                    <span class="default-highlight">Cypress</span> and assisted in monitoring applications using 
                    <span class="default-highlight">Prometheus</span>, <span class="default-highlight">Grafana</span>, 
                    and centralized logging systems.

                <p class="default-p">
                    I have to tell you — I know you probably hear this a lot from other developers, but this much is true: 
                    my passion for technology goes far beyond work — <span class="default-highlight">I <em>am</em></span> 
                    the kind of person who finds joy in <span class="default-highlight">debugging tricky issues</span> 
                    and learning the intricacies of new frameworks just for fun. It's one of the reasons I pursued a 
                    Master's Degree — driven by sheer curiosity to <span class="default-highlight">turn the unknown into the known</span>.
                    I enjoy diving into documentation, 
                    exploring innovative solutions, and <span class="default-highlight">sharing knowledge</span> with my peers. 
                    Whether setting up a personal project to experiment with the latest tech stack or collaborating on a 
                    challenging problem, I'm motivated by curiosity and the thrill of continuous learning. This mindset fuels 
                    my technical growth and, I believe, helps contribute to a positive, dynamic team culture.

                    pesto sauce, Linux, <span class="default-highlight">instrumental music</span>, physics and math, and the joy of community experiences. 
                    I wish I could tell you how much I love philosophy and the stories of explorers. When traveling, I enjoy documenting my 
                    <span class="default-highlight">whereabouts</span> and <span class="default-highlight">experiences</span>,  
                    so I can revisit them later.

                    I’m a Frontend Developer from Pakistan, passionate about building responsive and user-friendly websites and web applications.

                <p class="default-p">
                    My journey into web development began during my studies when I discovered the power of combining design with code. I started creating UI components and experimenting with frameworks like <span class="default-highlight">Angular</span>, <span class="default-highlight">React</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">PrimeNG</span>. This hands-on approach helped me understand not just the aesthetics but also the logic behind great interfaces.

                <p class="default-p">
                    Since then, I’ve worked on several web projects, contributing to both professional and academic platforms. From managing websites in <span class="default-highlight">WordPress</span> to building dynamic dashboards and contact forms in Angular, I've developed a solid understanding of frontend architecture, state management, and component-based design.

                    My expertise includes writing clean HTML, CSS, and TypeScript code, integrating REST APIs, handling routing, and optimizing user experiences across all devices. I also enjoy implementing animations, working with reusable UI components, and debugging with browser tools.
